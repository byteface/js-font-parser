\f0\fs24 \cf0 So I had an actionscript font parser and have ported that to javascript. It loads truetype fonts and draws the outlines to canvas. It has many potential uses so throwing it up into git. I get quite busy myself so this is as much a free to take resource as anything else. Would be great to see it evolve here, but either way have fun.}
